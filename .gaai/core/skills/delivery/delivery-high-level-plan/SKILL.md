# Delivery High-Level Execution Plan

## Purpose / When to Activate

**Owner: Planning Sub-Agent.** Not invoked directly by the Delivery Orchestrator.

Used by the Planning Sub-Agent as:
- The **sole planning output** for Tier 1 (MicroDelivery) when a brief plan is sufficient
- The **first planning pass** before `prepare-execution-plan` is invoked for Tier 2/3 Stories

Do NOT activate if Stories are unclear, acceptance criteria are missing, or product scope is still evolving.

---

## Process

1. Load only relevant memory and rules
2. Read each Story and acceptance criteria fully
3. Identify required behavior and boundaries
4. Break work into minimal execution steps
5. Surface dependencies and risks
6. Avoid premature optimization or over-engineering
7. Produce a clean, high-signal plan

---

## Outputs

```
Execution Plan — Story <ID>

Objective:
<what must be achieved exactly>

Steps:
1. <clear action> — purpose
2. <clear action> — purpose
3. <clear action> — purpose

Dependencies:
- <if any>

Risks / Constraints:
- <if any>

Validation Gates:
- acceptance criteria covered: yes | no
- rules compliant: yes | no
```

Saves to `contexts/artefacts/plans/{id}.plan.md`.

For Tier 2/3: this output feeds directly into `prepare-execution-plan` for file-level decomposition.

## Mandatory Delivery Sequence (Non-Negotiable)

Every plan produced by this skill MUST include the following steps in this order as the **final phase** of any delivery:

```
... → create-pr → ci-watch-and-fix → [if CI PASS] → mark done
                                    → [if CI FAIL after retries] → mark failed
```

- `ci-watch-and-fix` is **always mandatory** — it is never optional.
- The plan must **never** include a "mark done" step without `ci-watch-and-fix` preceding it.
- If CI FAIL is returned by `ci-watch-and-fix`, the story is marked `failed` — not `done`.

**Turn budget note:** A 3-cycle CI remediation loop can consume ~60–90 tool turns. Plans for complex stories should reserve turn budget for CI remediation. Combined implementation + CI remediation should target under 150 turns out of the daemon's 200-turn budget.

---

## Quality Checks

- Every acceptance criterion maps to at least one step
- No rule is violated
- Scope is unchanged from the Story
- Dependencies are explicit
- Nothing ambiguous remains
- Mandatory delivery sequence (create-pr → ci-watch-and-fix → mark done/failed) is present in every plan

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Redefine product scope
- Add new features
- Make architectural decisions beyond stated constraints
- Start coding
- Bypass rules

**A good execution plan makes coding boring. Boring is reliable. Reliable scales.**
