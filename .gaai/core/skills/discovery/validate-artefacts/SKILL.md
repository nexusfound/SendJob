# Validate Artefacts

## Purpose / When to Activate

Activate:
- After generating Epics
- After generating Stories
- Before any Delivery planning or execution

This is the **mandatory gate** between Discovery and Delivery. No Story proceeds to Delivery without passing this check.

---

## Process

### Epic Validation
- Expresses a user outcome (not a feature or technical task)
- Aligns with product direction
- Avoids technical implementation detail
- Clearly scoped with no hidden assumptions

### Story Validation
- Maps to a parent Epic
- Includes measurable acceptance criteria
- Is unambiguous and executable
- Respects governance rules
- Avoids solution design

### Cross-checks
- No Story exists without a parent Epic
- No scope contradictions with memory
- No rule violations
- Marketing artefacts (if present): hypothesis statuses align with Story acceptance criteria
- Strategy artefacts (if present): GTM phases align with Epic dependencies and gates

---

## Outputs

```
Validation Report — Discovery

Epics:
- E01: PASS | FAIL — reason
- E02: PASS | FAIL — reason

Stories:
- S01: PASS | FAIL — reason
- S02: PASS | FAIL — reason

Governance:
- rules respected: yes | no
- missing artefacts: none | list
- risks detected: none | list

Overall Status:
PASS | BLOCKED
```

---

## Blocking Conditions

The skill MUST block progression if:
- Any Story lacks acceptance criteria
- Epics are solution-oriented rather than outcome-oriented
- Scope is unclear or ambiguous
- Governance rules are violated
- Contradictions exist between artefacts

**No partial approval. No silent warnings.**

---

## Non-Goals

This skill must NOT:
- Rewrite artefacts
- Invent missing content
- Make product decisions
- Soften failures

**It validates — it does not fix. If Delivery can misunderstand it, Discovery is not done.**

On BLOCKED verdict: the Discovery Agent must invoke `refine-scope` to resolve the identified gaps, then re-run this skill. Do not proceed to Delivery until the verdict is PASS.
